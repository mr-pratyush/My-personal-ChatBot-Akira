# 🚀 Akira – Personal Generative AI Chatbot  

**Akira** is a personal Generative AI chatbot that I (Pratyush Gautam) designed and developed **end-to-end** to showcase how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated with **retrieval-augmented pipelines**, embeddings, and custom frontends.  

Unlike pre-built solutions, Akira was crafted from scratch — covering **data ingestion, embedding generation, vector search, LLM orchestration, API integration, and frontend design**. The chatbot is capable of answering context-driven questions from a knowledge base in a reliable and interactive way.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Backend Frameworks**: Python, FastAPI  
- **LLM Orchestration**: LangChain, LangGraph  
- **Embeddings & Vector Store**: FAISS / Pinecone  
- **Frontend**: Custom-designed React interface (UI/UX designed by me)  
- **Data Pipeline**: Document ingestion, chunking, embedding, retrieval  
- **Deployment Ready**: Works with Docker & API-first architecture

## ✨ Features  

- **End-to-End RAG Workflow**: Query → Embeddings → Vector Search → Context Retrieval → LLM Response  
- **Custom Frontend**: Clean, user-friendly UI designed by me  
- **Confidence Scoring**: Helps users evaluate reliability of answers  
- **Context Awareness**: Fetches relevant chunks for precise responses  
- **Semantic Search Optimization**: Uses vector similarity for accuracy  
- **Scalable Backend**: Easily extensible for enterprise use cases

## ⚡ Current Limitations  

- Limited to the scope of ingested knowledge base (not a general-purpose AI like ChatGPT).  
- Requires fine-tuning for very large document collections.  
- Frontend is functional but can be enhanced with animations & advanced styling.  
- No public deployment yet (runs locally / private cloud).  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements  

- Integration with advanced **LangGraph agent workflows**  
- Support for **streaming responses**  
- **User authentication & role-based access** for enterprise use cases  
- Improved **frontend interactivity** with advanced visualization
